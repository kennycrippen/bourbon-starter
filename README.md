# bourbon-starter  
A starter WordPress theme based on Bourbon Neat. Activate this theme on a WordPress site, then begin writing tasty Bourbon Neat Sass and creating template files.  
Basic functions included as well as the excellent Slick JS Slider.

#### Grunt  
All Sass compiles with Grunt. All JS compiles and minifies with Grunt. Icy cool. :)  

Keep watching this repo as this project will most likely always be in development. I plan to keep it a bare bones starting point which includes many tools used in my dev process.
